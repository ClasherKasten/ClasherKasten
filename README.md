- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClasherKasten and right now I'm living in 🇩🇪 
- 👀 I’m mainly interested backend development (as a web developer).
- 🌱 I’m currently deepdiving into Python and improving my knowlege about some of the most important Flask(-Extensions).
Because i mostly use Flask-Alchemy i don't learn SQL much, but i know the basic principles of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool Python Projects to improve my practical skills with the language and git,
But i wouldn't say no to other projects.
- 📫 You can contact me over my E-Mail address `cfb1470@gmail.com`.
