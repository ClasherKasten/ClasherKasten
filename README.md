- 👋 Hi, I’m @ClasherKasten and right now I'm living in 🇩🇪 
- 👀 I’m interested in Web development as a Backend developer. Frontend is also not bad, 
but it isn't my preference.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepdiving into Python with Flask and all the Flask-Extensions. 
But also i try to improve my Javascript skills for doing better Frontend code.
HTML and CSS are not in my focus, but sometimes i learn something new about these languages.
Because i use Flask-Alchemy i doen't learn SQL much, but i know the basic principles of it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool Python Projects to improve my practical skills with the language and git,
But i wouldn't say no to other projects.
- 📫 You can contact me over my E-Mail address `cfb1470@gmail.com`.
